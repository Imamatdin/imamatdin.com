I aim to be a technical generalist - learning a new technical skill feels like adding a new tool to my toolbox + learning a new way to build things, that comes with lots of new frameworks for looking at problems.

Over the past few years, I've been exploring areas like systems engineering, machine learning, zero-knowledge cryptography, web3 engineering, computational neuroscience, and electrical engineering.

Here are some of the things that I've built - WIP

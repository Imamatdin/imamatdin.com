### Hi Anthropic ðŸ‘‹

I'm Adam Majmudar.

I'm a fast learner & first principled thinker who believes [you can learn anything](https://x.com/MajmudarAdam/status/1815467430770315388).

<Tweet1 />

Recently, I applied this philosophy by doing [deep dives](/deep-dives), where I speed ran learning the engineering stack and market dynamics of the most important technology frontiers.

My intention with this process was to understand where the future of technology is headed, so I can position myself in front of it.

<br />

**1. Chips**

[I taught myself to design & make chips from scratch in ~2 weeks](https://x.com/MajmudarAdam/status/1778235769150423121)

<Tweet2 />

<br />

**2. GPUs**

[I designed a minimal GPU in ~2 weeks (and hardened my design)](https://x.com/MajmudarAdam/status/1783304235909877846)

**3. Deep Learning**

[I reframed and reimplemented the entire history of deep-learning in ~3 weeks](https://x.com/MajmudarAdam/status/1794190796411027791)

**4. Energy**

[I taught myself about every segment of the energy industry and made one complete resource on everything in ~4 weeks](https://energyandhumanity.com/)

<Tweet5 />

<br />

**5. Robotics**

[I synthesized the history of robotics research to understand the future of humanoids in ~6 weeks](https://github.com/adam-maj/robotics)

<br />

I also [read constantly](/reading) and work to update my understanding of the world. I am always observing and evaluating events, experiences, and people around me.

<br />

### Work

**Bain Capital Ventures** [2024]

Iâ€™m currently a researcher in residence at Bain Capital Ventures; they support me on my deep dives, and I assist on their investment portfolio.

<br />

**thirdweb** [2021 - 2024]

I spent 3 years as the founding engineer of [thirdweb](https://x.com/thirdweb). Weâ€™ve raised $29M to date ([Series A](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/24/thirdweb-raises-24m-at-a-160m-valuation-from-haun-ventures-shopify-and-coinbase-for-its-web3-development-kit/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHS2V8ediUoiamWRhr4JfkQ6wzxqTsCP5Z33rw09WZofRjI3-AFtkJ1jdylY5yESVBaudAiON0oTWlJMDybVqylTybVoH8U1PIXQlvn_77HgcpvwuaRHONpkBAsXM-WNFm6ZwqFgzUKWhZVqUP8TYJuNwdGIHcDFj4oyc12pXdWM)). Our tools are used by 200,000+ developers, and companies like Coinbase, AWS, Shopify, etc.

During my time there, I personally led the development of several products across infrastructure & SDKs that have served 100,000+ customers.

I primarily worked here to learn from my co-founders [Furqan Rydhan](https://x.com/FurqanR) (CEO), who was the founding CTO of AppLovin (IPO: APP, $20B) and [Steven Bartlett](https://x.com/StevenBartlett) (founding CMO), who IPOâ€™d his first company for $600M and now runs [The Diary of a CEO](https://www.youtube.com/@TheDiaryOfACEO) podcast (8M+ subscribers).

<br />

**Dovetale** [2020 - 2021]

I spent 1 year building Machine Learning systems at Dovetale, which was [acquired by Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/collabs/find-brands). I worked here because [Mike Schmidt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikenschmidt/) (CEO) was a personal mentor in high school.

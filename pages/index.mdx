**Some things about me:**

- I'm currently in residence at [Bain Capital Ventures](https://baincapitalventures.com/) doing [deep dives](/deep-dives). Before this, I spent 3 years as a founding engineer at [thirdweb](https://x.com/thirdweb).
- I studied computer science and neuroscience at the University of Pennsylvania. I've been on leave of absence for the past 2 years.
- I like creating things [writing, software, startups]. Startups are cool because they make creating things profitable & scalable.
- I see art as the product of any creative process with constraints. I view startups as the art form of capitalism, and life as the ultimate art form.
- My personal philosophy has changed drastically over the past decade. My current world view is a synthesis of ideas from [non-dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism), [Kashmir Shaivism](/reading/tantra-illuminated), [Advaita Vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta), and Christianity.

**Some things I'm interested in:**

- Neuroscience and neurotech. They combine many of my biggest interests: computation, intelligence, consciousness, and philosophy.
- Education, especially in early development where many critical behaviors are solidifed.
- Health and fitness. I like optimizing for athleticism as the balance between aesthetics and functionality.
- I like learning new things, especially from people who see beauty in their subject.
- I like beautiful art of all forms [anime, visual arts, music, games]. Good art creates a feeling that can't be replicated by anything else.

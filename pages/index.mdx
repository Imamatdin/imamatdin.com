# Adam Majmudar

I'm a constant learner and aspiring technical generalist.

I'm a founding engineer at [thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com) ([Series A](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/24/thirdweb-raises-24m-at-a-160m-valuation-from-haun-ventures-shopify-and-coinbase-for-its-web3-development-kit/)), where we&apos;re building the complete development and infrastructure framework for building web3 applications (think Stripe or AWS for web3).

I'm also currently a student on gap year from the University of Pennsylvania, where I&apos;m studying Computer Science, Cognitive Science, and Neuroscience.

**Currently, I&apos;m most interested in:**

- Web3 (scaling solutions, zero-knowledge cryptography, account abstraction)
- Psychedelics, neuroscience, & meditation
- Philosophy, psychology, & epistemology (existentialism, nondualism, etc.)
- [and much more...](/notes)

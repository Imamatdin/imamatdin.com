**Some things about me:**

Currently I am penning my journey, scripting my story, composing my harmony, painting my vision, engineering my future. 

- I'm doing Activate at TKS where I am working on quantum computing and AR engineering design.
- Before this, I was in Innovate where I worked on Autonomous vehicles, pitched to companies like Microsoft and IKEA.
- I love creating things, especially software, art, poems, interesting projects.


**Some things I'm interested in:**

- Entrepreneurship. 
- Environmental science. I live in an area that is suffering the consequences of a natural disaster that happened in 1950s. Once 4th largest sea dried up because of human irresponsibility.
- Education, especially in early development (ages 0-14) where many critical behaviors are solidifed. I will work on this in the future.
- Neuroscience and neurotech. They combine many of my biggest interests: computation, intelligence, consciousness, and philosophy.
- Health and fitness. I have been playing basketball for 5 years now, and I like optimizing for athleticism as the balance between aesthetics and functionality.
- I like learning new things, especially from people who see beauty in their subject. I am interested in learning about everything important and am trying to stay curious.
- I like beautiful art of all forms: animated movies, visual arts, music, games.

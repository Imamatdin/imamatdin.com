**Some things about me:**

Currently I am penning my journey, scripting my story, composing my harmony, painting my vision, engineering my future.

- I'm doing Activate at TKS where I am working on quantum computing and AR engineering design.
- Before this, I was in Innovate where I worked on Autonomous vehicles.
- I love creating things, especially software, art, poems, interesting projects.


**Some things I'm interested in:**

- Environmental science. I live in an area that is suffering the consequences of a natural disaster that happened in 1950s. Some of my work was inspired by it.
- Health and fitness. I had been playing basketball for 5 years, and I like optimizing for athleticism as the balance between aesthetics and functionality.
- I like learning new things, especially from people who see beauty in their subject. I am interested in learning about everything important and am trying to stay curious.
- Animated movies. I am a big fan of Arcane: League of Legends. Even though I stopped playing video games 5-6 years ago and never played LL, I loved the animation and the story.

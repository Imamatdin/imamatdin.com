Why are you so afraid
To take the leap into the unknown

Isn’t a small chance at greatness
Better than the guarantee of mediocrity

How can you be comfortable in your current routine  
When you say you want to achieve your full potential  
But you’re making no progress toward it

What are you afraid of?  
You’re afraid that you’re going to end up a failure?  
That everyone will see you as a shell of what you once were?  
And yet, in your current state
You are the shell  
Of who you could be  
But you can’t see that  
From where you stand

All it takes is one decision  
But you can’t muster the confidence to make it  
Constantly deliberating over the possibilities  
Enumerating what could go wrong
Projecting failure in every form
Underestimating the abilities that you know you have  
Content with the way things are

And you allow this fear
To prevent you from taking the leap  
For far too long

But when you finally take the first step  
You realize that your fear was misguided  
All the time spent paralyzed in fear wasted  
With nothing to be afraid of

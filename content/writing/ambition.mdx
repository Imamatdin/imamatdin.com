title: The breaking point of ambition
description: Why "pragmatism" often triumphs over ambition as we get older

When you&apos;re young, the world is your oyster.

Every door is open for you to explore, every opportunity seems to be knocking at your doorstep.

And best of all - you have the power to be anything.

Because you haven&apos;t gone down any specific path, you have the freedom to explore any path that interests you.

More importantly, you&apos;re free to set your ambitions and goals and shoot for the stars - as many ambitious kids do.

This ambition is exactly what leads to incredible creation - amazing products, beautiful art, impactful research.

Clearly, it takes great ambition to opt to take the path of uncertainty, to pursue dreams like building self-landing rockets, creating the internet, or assembling the first computer.

But as you get older, that ambition often gets replaced with very different emotions - like fear, risk avoidance, and pragmatism.

These often push people away from their ambitions, toward more certain paths that may lead to less satisfaction and contentment.

But why do we stray toward certainty as we get older? What causes people to give up on their dreams and start optimizing for "practicality"?

I&apos;ve noticed that when we&apos;re young, we&apos;re protected by the fact that our dreams and ambitions _always lie in the future._

People are always thinking about “starting a company when they&apos;re older” or “getting rich when they&apos;re older” or “working on X problem” - and they can be content that they have this longer term direction.

But at some point, the future becomes the present, and you realize that now is the time to make your goal happen.

And that thought can be scary.

At this point, its easy to get demoralized, and it&apos;s easy to doubt your goals.

But I like to think that this doubt is unjustified, and that the future is still yours to create (as romanticized and potentially unrealistic of a belief it may seem).

I think there's something to be said about having irrational conviction toward a worthy goal.

Recenty, I've seen more people fall into this trap (as have I in the past, although I think I've been able to get past it, at least temporarily).

I suspect that it may be a natural part of the coming of age processs for all young people with a hint of ambition.

But every time I see someone who knows they love art or music or writing or building or anything else start recruiting for finance jobs or shooting for a job at a big tech company, just because it's the path of certainty they've been told to follow, it makes me wish I could convince them to take a leap of faith.

But I don&apos;t think I can yet do this responsibly - because I don&apos;t think I know enough about the world to be able to tell someone that they should still pursue their dreams (mayb I&apos;m wrong, an the path of pragmatism is actually better in most cases).

But at least, I can leave you with a few of my observations on what types of scenarios cause people to give up on their ambitions, and maybe will help to put things into perspective if you have ever experience these.

- Seeing someone else that appears to be farther along in your goals than you are → causes you to think - man, maybe I&apos;m actually not good enough to achieve this, if someone else is doing better. The fallacy here is that it&apos;s not a zero-sum game.
- The present catches up with the future - and you no longer have the protection of certainty, or an excuse. You&apos;ve always dreamed of becoming a startup founder, since you were young. But now college is about to finish and you aren&apos;t a founder yet. Now it&apos;s a daunting task, so you turn back to the default path in front of you.
- Following the crowds. Our systems (especially college) push people away from ambitions toward paths of certainty. Certainty always looks nicer in the short term. It&apos;s important to remember that predictable paths yield predictable results.

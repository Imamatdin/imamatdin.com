## Overview

An integrated system for monitoring and optimizing the Aral Basin ecosystem. The platform combines satellite data pipelines, foundation models, and practical applications to address one of the world's worst environmental disasters.

## Infrastructure

**Satellite Data Pipeline:**
- Sentinel-1/2 (SAR and optical)
- MODIS and VIIRS (aerosol and nighttime lights)
- Landsat (long-term archive)

**Climate/Weather Pipeline:**
- ERA5 reanalysis
- MERRA-2 aerosol data

**Ground Data Integration:**
- UNDP air quality stations
- Uzhydromet historical records
- CA-discharge river measurements

## Foundation Models

- **Prithvi-EO-2.0**: Fine-tuned for Central Asia land/water segmentation, salinity mapping
- **Chronos-2**: Fine-tuned for environmental time-series forecasting

## Applications

1. **Dust Early Warning System**: Real-time alerts for dust storms affecting communities
2. **Irrigation Scheduler**: RL-based optimization for cotton farming water use
3. **Water Allocation Optimizer**: Basin-wide optimization for scarce water resources
4. **Crop Yield Predictor**: Satellite-based yield forecasting
5. **Salinity Risk Mapper**: Soil salinity prediction for agricultural planning
6. **Crop Disease Detector**: Mobile-friendly disease identification

## Research Papers (Planned)

1. "Foundation Models for Aral Sea Environmental Monitoring"
2. "Deep RL for Irrigation Optimization in Central Asia"
3. "AI-Powered Water Allocation for the Aral Basin"
4. "Glacier Monitoring and Water Supply Forecasting for Central Asia"
5. "Groundwater Depletion Modeling with GRACE and Machine Learning"
6. "Multi-Decadal Desertification Analysis with Temporal Deep Learning"

## Timeline

**January-June 2026**: Build platform, train models, deploy applications
**July 2026**: Open source release, user acquisition, press coverage

## Target Impact

- 200+ dust alert users
- 10+ farmer pilots for irrigation optimization
- First AI-powered environmental monitoring platform for Central Asia
- Open source models and datasets for the research community

## The Story

"18-year-old from Karakalpakstan built comprehensive AI platform for environmental monitoring and agricultural optimization in the Aral Sea disaster zone—deployed with real users—while simultaneously advancing datacenter cooling research."

## Status

Development starting January 2026. Master repo structure planned, compute credit applications pending.

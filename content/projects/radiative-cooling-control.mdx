## Overview

This research project implements a DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) agent to optimize radiative cooling systems for datacenters. The agent learns to control the split between radiative panels and cooling towers to minimize electricity consumption and water usage.

## Key Innovation

**Problem**: Current radiative cooling systems use fixed-flow control and shut down during marginal conditions (cloudy, humid weather), wasting potential cooling hours.

**Solution**: Adaptive flow control using reinforcement learning that:
- Continues operation during marginal conditions by reducing flow rate
- Learns to anticipate weather changes using forecasts
- Optimizes the trade-off between electricity and water savings

## Results

| Controller | Electricity Savings | Water Savings |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Tower Only | -4.6% | 0% |
| Fixed 50% | 1.4% | 25.1% |
| Fixed 100% | 1.5% | 26.5% |
| **DDPG (Ours)** | **5.8%** | **65.2%** |

## Research Context

This was a gap year research project exploring the intersection of reinforcement learning and sustainable datacenter operations.

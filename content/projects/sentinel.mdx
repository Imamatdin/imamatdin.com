## Overview

SENTINEL is an autonomous penetration testing platform where AI agents simultaneously attack and defend a target application. Red team agents discover and exploit vulnerabilities while blue team agents monitor traffic, detect attacks, and deploy countermeasures. Watch the battle unfold in real-time through a monochrome dashboard.

Built for the Cerebras "Need for Speed" hackathon. Cerebras inference speed (1000-1700 tok/s) enables sub-second defensive responses to attacks.

## How It Works

- **Red Team Agents**: Discover and exploit vulnerabilities autonomously
- **Blue Team Agents**: Monitor traffic, detect attacks, deploy countermeasures
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Watch the battle unfold live
- **Sub-second Response**: Powered by Cerebras LLMs at 1000-1700 tok/s

## Tech Stack

- Cerebras LLMs for inference
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Autonomous agent orchestration

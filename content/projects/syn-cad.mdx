## Overview

SynCAD is an AI-powered CAD code generation tool with validation. Describe parts in plain English, get manufacturable STL files in seconds.

## What it does

1. **Natural language → OpenSCAD code** via LLM (Groq/Gemini)
2. **Automatic validation** - compiles with OpenSCAD, catches errors
3. **Retry on failure** - feeds error back to LLM for correction
4. **Outputs STL** - ready for 3D printing or manufacturing

## CADBench

Included benchmark for evaluating LLM-generated CAD:

- **Format compliance** - clean code output (no markdown, no preamble)
- **Compilation** - OpenSCAD parses without errors
- **Geometric accuracy** - bounds, volume, surface area match expected
- **Parametric robustness** - CLI `-D` overrides work correctly

## Examples

| Prompt | Result |
|--------|--------|
| "A cube 30x30x30mm centered at origin" | ✓ Compiled |
| "A plate 80x50x5mm with 10mm hole in center" | ✓ Compiled |
| "L-bracket with mounting holes" | ✓ Compiled |
| "Gear with 8 holes around perimeter" | ✓ Compiled |

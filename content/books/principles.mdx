I skimmed through the first section on Ray Dalio's life, and mainly read the second section on Dalio's Life Principles. The principles are very broad - they're almost meta-principles for thinking about what to prioritize. I found them too broad to extract too much tangible out of them, but they were thought-provoking.

The biggest thing I got out of this book, moreso the value of any of the individual principles, was the concept of creating a set of explicit principles by which you make decisions by - I find that these principles are usually implicit and are rarely written down.

A compilation of Charlie Munger's best speeches. He focuses on the importance of building multi-disciplinary knowledge, understanding "the big ideas from the big disciplines, and always using inversion in thinking and communication. He particularly highlights the relevance of human psychology and cognitive biases.

Excellent essays on the psychology of human misjudgement, the surprisingly destructive nature of bad practice in corporate accounting, and using the first principles of psychology to design a plan for a $2T business.

His speeches often don't translate well to writing; the transcribed format misses out on delivery and audience reactions, and the pacing and concision are suboptimal for a book.

Many of the topics lacked broad applicability and felt like they were included due to a lack of content to select from. Rather than presenting a full picture of Munger's thinking, this book felt like a small slice of some of his ideas with lots of repetition across chapters.

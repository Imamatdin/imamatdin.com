A crazy story about grit and the limits of the human will. It follows the story of the famous crew assembled by Ernest Shackleton to try to make the first ever succesful expedition across Antarctica - except there boat gets trapped in ice an submerge near the beginning of their voyage, and they're force to survive the brutal Arctic winter in the cold, with few resources.

Stories like these are always a nice gratitude shock - they put things into perspective for how bad things could be. I thought the book could get quite slow at times, hence my rating, but still an interesting read.

The most simple and effective strategy for productivity. This book reduces the art of execution to its most minimal form and structures it into a set of memorable principles. 

Worth reading the first part for its philosophy on productivity. The second part gets into tactical advice which is several decades outdated, so just read for the principles and then adapt to your own system.

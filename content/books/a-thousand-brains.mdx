An interesting new theory for thinking about how brain systems operate at a high-level. Hawkins argues for the significance of independent cortical-columns in the brain as individual functional units to synthesize information. The theory seems plausible but unlikely to capture the full picture, as can describe most theories.

I wish the book went into more technical detail on the theory an it's implications, but instead only the first third of the book is dedicated to it. Then the next two-thirds of the book are dedicated to Hawkins' theories on AI and the future of humanity, which are largely unrelated and also a bit incongruous.

Great overview of the frameworks needed to build a high performing organization. Mostly focused on building out hiring pipelines and attracting talent, leading effectively and strategic planning, and effective execution at a team level.

The first half was great, then it got a bit repetitive toward the end. The books is especially useful for engineers and others who haven't been as exposed to the operational side of business.

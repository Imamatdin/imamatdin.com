Excellent required reading for all ambitious young people that want to build impactful and successful careers. Covers almost all of the classic pitfalls of ego that plight so many young people - especially those exposed to the startup, tech, and Silicon Valley scenes at a young age.

Each chapter is a new powerful lesson on restraint, humility, attitude, and much more. The chapter on "The Canvas Method" is especially powerful, and should be read by everyone.

Accounts from the father of American psychedelic research on the nature of DMT experiences as observed during the first ever clinical trials of the drug. A very interesting book for anyone curious about psychedelics and the breadth of the types of experiences they can produce.

Gets a bit long with the individual accounts, and also I suspect that the accounts are a partial picture of the DMT experience/what we can gather from it given the importance of set & setting in psychedelic experiences and the nature of the suboptimal clinical setting of these experiments.

Great practical read on memory and how you can hack your own memory. The coolest takeaway is the "mind palace" method, which is the method all professional memory competitors use to memorize large amounts of information like lists, phone numbers, stacks of cards, books, and more - you learn the method in the book, and you get to try it yourself - and it works scarily well, right off the bat.

A very cool introduction to the world of memory hacking and memory competitions, with lots of practical tips and tricks.

The definitive book on building habits. I hesitated to read this one, because I thought it would be like most self-help books with a few simple concepts that are generally intuitive. I was definitely wrong. The book is extremely information-dense with useful tips/strategies to effectively build habits, pretty much every new chapter introduces new strategies that you can actually use.

Especially valuable considering how important of a life-skill building habits is (a few of the most high impact practices in life are habits - daily exercise, reading, eating healthy, meditation, etc.)

I just wish I implemented some of it right after I read the book, but I ended up using one of the tips in there (habit stacking) a year after reading and its helped a lot.

One of my favorite fiction books of all time. I cried a bit (both happy and sad tears) while reading it at a few different parts. Great use of first person - the books is written as if it were the journal of the mentally challenged Charlie Gordon, who undergoes an experimental surgery to increase his intelligence. The book is a great exploration of effects of intelligence on the human psyche, but I also especially love the attention to detail in each character's psychology.

As someone who draws many observations from tone/people's psychology in real life, it felt like the same type of observations could be made accurately about the characters in the book because of the depth of how they have been written. ie. you can tell how someone is feeling, why they are acting a certain way (good or bad), and understand their temperament and personality in a consistent and intentional (by the author) way just by reading how they talk. A very refreshing feeling in a book.

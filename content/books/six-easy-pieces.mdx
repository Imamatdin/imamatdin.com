I know my rating is a hot take, as this is considered one of the best introductory physics books of all time. Feynman definitely has his moments in the book where he introduces a great insight about some piece of physics and how it relates to the broader picture (for example, his discussion at the beginning of the book highlighting the true craziness of how everything is made of atoms, or his explanation of the double-slit experiment) - but I also felt that a lot of the book was bogged down in somewhat unmotivated technical convrsation which wasn't sufficiently explained.

Seeing other things from Feynman, I expected each topic to be broken down into much more fundamental pieces, but I found that lots of it was still taught similarly to typical high school physics.

I think part of my problem with the book is that I've already taken a college-level physics course and had a great physics professor in high school, so I was expecting a significant improvement from those, and didn't find it.

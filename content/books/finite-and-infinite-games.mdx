Very abstract book about the relationship between man and nature, and the games we partake in through our existence. Some really thought-provoking ideas interspersed with unjustified assertions and unrelated examples. Lacking in structure, concision, or clear articulation. More like a collection of interesting thoughts from James P. Carse.

Useful metaphors to apply to developing a life philosophy, specifically around framing life as an infinite game where play is the priority. This approach aligns with many eastern philosophies. Good observations on man's attempt to control nature, and the indifference of nature to man. Most topics covered better in other places.

Letters John D. Rockefeller wrote to his son on his philosophy of achievement that led him to his success in the oil business. The content is similar to other good success psychology books but Rockefeller's writing style and injection of anecdotes from his life make this more unique

Not the most complete or concise coverage of the topic, but a worthwhile reading experience with a few misses and several great letters.

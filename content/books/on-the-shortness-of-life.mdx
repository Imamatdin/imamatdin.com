Seneca has one message here which is quite simple: life is short, but we make it much shorter by spending time on things that are he believes are unimportant. As simple as it is, it's a very necessary reminder, and Seneca delivers it in a unique way that brings up relevant points/makes you seriously think about how you're spending your time, and if the things you're doing really matter to you. A short read, and I would say a worth-while one.

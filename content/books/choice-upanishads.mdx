A breakdown of the Upanishads by Parthasarthy. Mostly a good analysis of the texts and explains the concepts well. But when it comes to some of the more difficult Upanishads, specifically covering non-dualism, Parthasarthy gives an unnecessary flowery and poetic explanation in a way that isn't very helpful (he describes non-dual concepts in a way that someone who already subscribes to non-dualism can understand, but someone who does not could not learn from). Generally good just because the Upanishads themselves have a lot of wisdom within them.

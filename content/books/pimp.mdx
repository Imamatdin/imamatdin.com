The life story of the renowned Chicago pimp Iceberg Slim. He tells his story as it is, with all the gory details. His writing style is raw, crass, and highly readable.

The most negative, vile, degenerate book that I've ever read, but also an interesting and unique account. I had to binge this book in one day to isolate the degeneracy. You can get a sense for what the book will be like by reading the first page of the introduction.

For what it is, Iceberg Slim actually did an excellent job writing this book. My low rating is just for how toxic and unproductive the topic is, though there are certainly some useful lessons for those looking for them.

I wouldn't recommend it to most people, but for those comfortable with the depraved walks of life and intrigued to psychologically explore, I can promise the most jarring and out-of-distribution reading experience you'll have.

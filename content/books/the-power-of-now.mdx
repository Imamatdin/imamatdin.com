One of the best philosophy books I've ever read. Eckart Tolle seems as close to enlightened as anyone I've ever seen or heard. This book is extremely dense with insight on happiness and how to live a peaceful life. I'll definitely keep coming back to this book over time and read it several times. I would consider it necessary reading for anyone that's interested in philosophy or spirituality, or who wants to live peacefully and happily (which is everyone, basically).

One of the best philosophy books I've read, especially as an introduction into more nuanced spiritual thinking. Eckart Tolle seems as close to enlightened as any public spiritual leader. This book is dense with insight on happiness and how to live a peaceful life.

I would consider it necessary introductory reading for anyone that's interested in philosophy or spirituality, or who wants to live a peaceful life.

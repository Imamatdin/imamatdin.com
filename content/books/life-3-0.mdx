I read this book while AI was in a bit of a lull (compared with how it has become recently) and when there were a number of low value-add AI companies popping up to capitalize on the buzzword, so I was a bit jaded with AI at the time. And still, the book completely amazed me and rekindled my interest in AI.

The introductory story at the beginning of the book is a classic for thinking about what general intelligence could look like, and the book in general serves as a good overview of what the future of AI could hold for us/how we should be thinking about it. A worthwhile read for anyone interested in the future of AI/the ethics of general intelligence.

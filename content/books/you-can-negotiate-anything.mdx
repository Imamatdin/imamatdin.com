Everything is negotiable. All authority can be challenged. Most people negotiate far less often than they should. Realizing this is a big mental unlock and agency boost. This book will show you how negotiation is primarily about power, and you actually have power that you don't realize in most situations. A great primer on the core principles of negotiation, with entertaining real life scenarios to build intuition.

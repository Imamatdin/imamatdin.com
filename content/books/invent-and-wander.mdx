A collection of Jeff Bezos' writing including his Amazon shareholder letters, speeches, and other thoughts.

His writing all focuses on a few important big ideas that he takes very seriously: long-term thinking, customer-obsession, focusing on the things that don't change, high standards, fast vs. careful decision making, his willingness to pay for many experiments to win big, etc. These few ideas are deeply embedded in Amazon's culture and are largely responsible for it's success.

Jeff is an unusually clear thinker and communicator, even among great CEOs. He is also more inclined toward the aesthetic and social aspects of value creation than I expected. I enjoyed reading his space colony vision for Blue Origin, which sharply contrasts Elon's colonize Mars vision for SpaceX.

Worth reading for Jeff's evergreen wisdom articulated in his own words. Skip past the repetitive parts and focus on the importance of the message.

The elements of success framed from the perspective of compounding yourself through small but intentional choices. Though he talks about typical self-help topics, Darren Hardy writes about them with a unique level of clarity.

I find his framing in this book to be the most effective and insightful presentation of the personal operating system that enables achievement.

He also gives sensible explanations for common empirical ideas that are often unnecessarily associated with mysticism, like the law of attraction.

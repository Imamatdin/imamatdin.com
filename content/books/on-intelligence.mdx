On the theory of intelligence, how its created in the brain, and how we could replicate it in machines.

The best explanation on the neuroscientific basis of intelligence. Hawkins highlights the intuitions behind the key principles that enable intelligence in the brain: hierarchical structure, memory-prediction frameworks, invariant representations, and auto-associations.

The book was written several decades ago before modern day deep learning. Impressively, many of the most defining advancements in AI directly correspond with the implementation of concepts he highlights here.

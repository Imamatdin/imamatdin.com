Incredible book on the theory of intelligence, what it is, what could give rise to it, and how it functions in the brain. Hawkins gives a great intuitive understading of different properties of all brain systems that give rise to intelligence. Amazingly, while the book was written several decades ago (before significant advancements in AI), many of the most game-changing advances in AI have been due to implementations of the same concepts he used to describe intelligence in the brain back then.

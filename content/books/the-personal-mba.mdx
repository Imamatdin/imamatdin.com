A collection of principles to understand every important aspect of building a great business.

Josh Kaufman highlights the 5 core functions of business: value creation, marketing, sales, value delivery, and finance. Next, he covers the human brain and how to work with yourself and others. Finally, he covers how to understand, analyze, and improve systems.

These categories sound simple, and most people are broadly familiar with all of them. However, Kaufman covers the first principles of each topic in a uniquely thorough way.

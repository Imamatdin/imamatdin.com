Everyone has dreams. Most people never achieve them. This book guides you to avoid this fate in your own life.

It shows you how to break the chains that keep most people from even trying to achieve their dreams, like the fear of failure and avoidance of criticism. Then it shows you the skills necessary to actually takeoff to success in every area of your life.

A more tactical guide to success than _Think And Grow Rich_, though it feels less complete. I found it most useful for the section on breaking the chains, which is a challenge everyone must overcome.

This is a stand in for all the essential texts of Kashmir Shaivism including the _Shiva Sutras_, _Spanda Karika_, _Vijnana Bhairava Tantra_, and _Sri Tantraloka_.

Kashmir Shaivism is the richest and most beautiful philosophy of life I've found anywhere. It provides an approach to enlightened living that's fully compatible with self-actualization through career (and modern society by extension), and emphasizes the inherent significance of artistic expression.

For those interested, I'd start by understanding non-dualism and Advaita Vedanta first, which may take a few years (of passive observation and reflection). I only fully appreciated Kashmir Shaivism with this context, as it's the synthesis of many prior philosophies including Advaita, Vishishtadvaita, and Tantra.

Importantly, I don't read these as Hindu religious texts (they aren't), but instead read them for their general philosophical value. I look past all the theistic symbolism and focus on the underlying meanings.

This is a stand in for all the essential texts of Kashmir Shaivism including the _Shiva Sutras_, _Spanda Karika_, _Vijnana Bhairava Tantra_, and _Sri Tantraloka_.

Kashmir Shaivism synthesizes the insights about the nature of reality from Advaita with the practicality of Vishishtadvaita and the appreciation for the arts and creation from Tantra.

It's the richest philosophy of life I've found anywhere. It provides a path to enlightenment that's completely compatible with self-actualization (and modern society by extension), and affirms the inherent significance of artistic expression.

To those interested, I would first start by understanding non-dualism and Advaita, and then come to Kashmir Shaivism after. Importantly, I don't read these as Hindu religious texts (they aren't), but instead read them for their general philosophical value. I look past all the theistic symbolism and focus on the underlying meanings.

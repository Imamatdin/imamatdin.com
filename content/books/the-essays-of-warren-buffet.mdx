The best selections from Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letters organized into a comprehensive breakdown of his investing philosophy. Important lessons on corporate governance, common stock markets, long-term investing, valuation, accounting, and much more.

Buffet explains the fundamentals of each of these topics with a simplicity and clarity I have never seen before. He frequently injects his wit and humor.

Berkshire is one of the only companies in the world that has managed to intentionally control the shareholders, volatility, and valuation of their own stock. This exceptional outcome is the result of Munger and Buffet treating all shareholders as business partners, a unique perspective which manifests in all of Buffet's writing.

An incredible introduction to investing and business and an inspiring account of the outliar success and management of Berkshire Hathaway.

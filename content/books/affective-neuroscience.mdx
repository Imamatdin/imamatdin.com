A perfect introduction to the neuroscience of emotional systems, taught by one of its most insightful teachers. Panksepp covers mtional systems from a variety of perspectives, laying out neuroanatomical, neurobiological, and neurochemical foundations, while taking into account relevant psychology an philosophy.

However, this textbook goes far beyond a relation of the facts as Panksepp also lays out his insights from carrying out his life's work in the field. He often takes a step back from the facts to offer thought-provoking computational and philosophical theories about brain systems, stops to point out the beauty of the brain, or to offer a personal anecdote about his own life & research.

Reread this classic after reading it in middle school and really liking it. It still has the same dark and uneasy tone, along with a somewhat bittersweet truth and inevitability of how Bod's life will need to end up in the end that makes it a nice read.

I didn't like it as much as when I was younger - but maybe because it's easier to appreciate at a younger age, closer to the age and mentality of Bod.

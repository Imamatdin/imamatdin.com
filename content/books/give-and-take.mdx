Excellent book on the nature of three different styles of engaging in interpersonal relationships: givers, takers, and matchers. It goes over how each of these strategies plays out in the world over different time horizons, exploring real life examples, and proposes an "optimal" style (which I won't spoil).

This was a formative book for me, as I found it to be a perfect articulation of my natural social tendencies, which I was able to more strongly adopt and understand the nuances of. I would highly recommend it to anyone (especially people curious about zero-sum and postive-sum thinking in regards to relationships).

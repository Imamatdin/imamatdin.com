Bell Labs independently invented the transistor, laser, solar photovoltaic cell, radio & satelite telecommunications, information theory, unix, C, C++. The research breakthroughs that happened here created the entire digital and information age.

This book is good insofar as it covers some of the stories behind these creations, but it leaves much to be desired. The author wastes so much of the book with useless details and uninteresting biographical documentation. He also offers very little insight on the organizational systems and culture that enabled Bell Labs, which is arguably the most important thing to understand about it.

Didn't go into it expecting too much, but ended up really liking it. Very high readability, almost like reading through a tweet storm for the entirity of the book - but great insights boiled down on almost every page on how/where to allocate time, what types of people to interact with, what to optimize for, and how to be happy, among many other things. Definitely worth a read, especially for young people who are just starting out in their careers.

An alien race far more technologically advanced than humanity descends on earth and takes control of human society. They transform society for the better, though their intentions are initially unclear and are slowly revealed throughout the book.

A unique premise, and many interesting ideas about what human society would look like in the hands of a far more intelligent and benevolent group in absolute power. The overall plot feels somewhat contrived and the mystery payoff underwhelming.

I generally find Arthur C. Clarke to be great at the micro of sci-fi writing [individual ideas, creative prose], but not as much at the macro [narrative structure, cohesion].

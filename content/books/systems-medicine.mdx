A first principled breakdown of diseases, covering hormone circuit malfunctions, autoimmune disorders, aging-related diseases, etc. With a few simple ideas, he manages to explain the majority of illnesses relevant to humans.

Excellent overview of the causes of aging and how we may prevent them. Also provides "The Periodic Table of Diseases" at the end that offers a new framing of the similarities between different diseases and how they can be used to explain causes and treatments.

This book completely changed how I think about health and longevity. It directly builds on Nassim Taleb's ideas about medicine from _Antifragile_.

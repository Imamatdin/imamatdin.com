Lee Kuan Yew turned Singapore from a third world country into a first world country under his leadership, one of the most impressive feats anyone has ever accomplished.

This book is his reflection on how he did it, with insights on everything from leadership and diplomacy to economics and gardening.

I read the first section about the foundations of each major Singaporean department and learned a lot. I skipped over the rest, which covered Singaporean history and diplomacy.

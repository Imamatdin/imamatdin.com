Lee Kuan Yew turned Singapore from a third world country into a first world country under his leadership, which is probably one of the most impressive feats anyone has ever accomplished. In this book, he reflects on his experience - effectively a guide on "how to build a country," with insights on everything from leadership and diplomacy to economics and gardening.

I read the first part of the book about the foundations of each major Singaporean department and learned a lot. Wasn't as interested in the later sections, which seemed to be more about Singaporean history and diplomacy, but I may come back to them in the future.

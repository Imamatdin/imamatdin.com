Lee Kuan Yew turned Singapore from a third world country into a first world country in his rule alone, which is probably one of the most impressive feats anyone has ever accomplished. In this book, he takes you through his own experience and how he did it with lots of reflections along the way.

Just being exposed to how someone who accomplished something so incredible thinks is valuable enough - but LKY also has a lot of great advice on how to be a good leader, and lots of observations to be made about his specific approach to essentially building out an entire country from scratch.

I read part I of the book (about the foundations of how he started Singapore in each sector) and learned a lot. Wasn't as interested in the later sections, which seemed to be more about Singapore history and diplomacy, but I may come back to them in the future.

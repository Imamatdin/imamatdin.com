An analysis of how Steve Jobs obsessively built simplicity into every part of Apple. Written by one of Apple's top marketing leaders who worked directly with Steve Jobs on famous campaigns like _Think Different_ and _Silhouettes_.

Simplicity is often massively undervalued. As organizations grow, the debt associated with complexity compounds. Apple avoided this by dedicating constant attention toward simplification. This book focuses on how Steve Jobs specifically implemented this obsession with simplicity in his organizations.

The key ideas in this book would stand to benefit every leader and organization. However, the book does get slightly repetitive after the first few chapters.

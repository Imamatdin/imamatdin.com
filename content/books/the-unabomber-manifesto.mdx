The manifesto of the Unabomber originally published by _The New York Times_ before they knew him to be Ted Kaczynski. He makes many great points about the nature of society.

Everyone needs the ability to create and achieve challenging goals. Kazcynski argues that technology is making all goals either to easy or too hard, leaving no good goals for most of society, and causing widespread distress.

Though his conclusion is incorrect, his observations on the psychology of leftism, the tendency for society to shape people and force them into it's molds, and the necessity of the power process are insightful.

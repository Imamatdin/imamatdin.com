An insightful guide to management strategy and tactics, formed by Andy Grove's decades of experience leading Intel. Explains all of management in terms of its first principles - this sounds straightforward but is extremely challenging given the breadth of the subject matter.

Opinionated in the best way possible - Grove has personally experimented with all the different approaches to common management challenges, and asserts the belief system he has developed from this experience.

An insightful guide to management strategy and tactics, formed by Andy Grove's decades of experience leading Intel. The only reference I've found that explains all of management in terms of its first principles.

Opinionated in the best way possible. Grove has personally experimented with all the different approaches to common management challenges, and presents the belief system he has developed from this experience with conviction.

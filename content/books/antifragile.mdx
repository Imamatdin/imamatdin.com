In a world full of randomness and disorder, designing systems that are built to benefit from volatility is the only way to avoid collapse. Taleb calls these things that gain from disorder _antifragile_.

He highlights how everything that has stood the test of time is antifragile and shows us how to use antifragility to account for volatility in our everyday lives and to build more robust systems.

He takes every opportunity to make fun academics and other people he considers leeches, making his writing unique and entertaining (and also very salty).

He explores a wide variety of topics related to the core idea of the book, all equally interesting, unintuitive, and consequential. His discussions on the barbell concept (for how to manage risk), iatrogenics (on harmful intervention), the value of optionality, and _via negativa_ are particularly insightful.

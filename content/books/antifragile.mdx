Volatility is often considered undesirable for the stability and growth of complex systems. Counter-intuitively, many systems actually benefit from uncertainty, and some that _need_ disorder to survive.

In a world full of randomness, often in places where people don't see it, designing systems that gain from disorder is the only way to ensure robustness. Taleb shows us how critical antifragility is, how it shows up in everything that has stood the test of time, and how to account for volatility in our everyday lives and the way we design our systems.

He's always salty and takes every opportunity to criticize academics and other people he considers leeches, making the writing entertaining if you can look past it. He explores a huge variety of topics related to the core idea of the book, all equally interesting, unintuitive, and consequential.

His discussions on the barbell concept (for how to manage risk), iatrogenics (on harmful intervention), the value of optionality, and _via negativa_ are particularly insightful.

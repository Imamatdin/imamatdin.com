A somewhat dense book about the history of our universe. I found it difficult to get through as Hawking frequently gets into considerable technical detail without first providing enough context to make the reader understand why they should be interested in what he's talking about/why it's significant.

I also felt like the readability wasn't great - I expected more of a narrative about the history of the universes creation with technical detail injected to fill in the gaps, but instead it was mostly losely strung together technical details without much broader context.

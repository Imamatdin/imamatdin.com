From the title, I expected that this would be more about manifestation/single focus and the psychology of achieving big results (more along the lines of Think and Grow Rich or The Secret). Instead, it's more about emotional regulation and mastery of your own mind - which was unexpected, but definitely welcome. The main premise is that we can control what we do in every domain by artificially conditioning ourselves to associate certain positive emotions with actions we want to take. Very powerful principle. He also sprinkles in lots of other wisdom about a variety of topics in life-mastery, including insights on personal, financial, and relationship success.

The examples are very dated now, which made it a bit tougher to get through, and I think some of his message is communicated better in other books now, but the core psychological principles are very valuable, and worth reading for. Also just to see inside the mind of probably one of the most incredible speakers of all time is interesting in itself.

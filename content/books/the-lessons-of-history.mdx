A concise history book full of unique observations and wisdom. After writing their 11 volume series _The Story of Civilization_ documenting the entire history of the West, Will & Ariel Durant organized their reflections about what they learned into this short 100 page book.

It covers their observations about what history reveals on biology, morals, character, religion, economics, government, war, and more. By looking to history, it also highlights many of the unintuitive empirical truths about human nature & civilization.

Beyond their insights on history, they also offer a beautiful perspective on what it means to be a historian, what history has to offer us, and what progress means for humanity.

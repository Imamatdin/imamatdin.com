Isaac Asimov said this was his favorite piece out of everything he had written, which made me curious to read it. I did, and definitely wasn't dissapointed. This is one of the best science fiction stories I've ever read, as short as it is (it's only 11 pages).

Very reminscent of the technooptimism and transhumanism often in found in places like SF, but played out over the course of the rest of humanities future. Great storytelling throughout, but there's one part that makes it amazing.

I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just say, everyone should read this, it takes less than 30 minutes. You can find it <a href="https://www.multivax.com/last_question.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

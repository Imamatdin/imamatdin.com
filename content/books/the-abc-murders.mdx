After reading _Murder on the Orient Express_ and _And Then There Were None_ I got accustomed to the creativity level of those mysteries, which are widely considered to be among Agathie Christie's best books.

This one felt more like a regular mystery book - still entertaining and enjoyable to read, but not at the same level of creativity of those books.

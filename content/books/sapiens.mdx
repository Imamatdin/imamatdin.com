The compelling history of humankind that explores how the power of stories has shaped the past and the present of our species. The core concept that religions, businesses, language and much more are all shared myths is a powerful one that casts a more high-clarity perspective on the world.
A necessary read for everyone. I would consider this a non-traditional history book - and one of the most unique/interesting history books I've ever read.

The most thorough and well written book on the philosophy and history of non-dual Shaiva Tantra.

Tantra has nothing to do with sex, though it has been completely misconstrued to be associated with it in the West. Instead, it's a large body of philosophies based on Indian spiritual texts known as _Tantras_ that covers a wide range of spiritual beliefs, some religious and ritualistic, others entirely philosophically inclined.

This book focuses on one strain of Tantras known as Kashmir Shaivism which provides a philosophy for enlightened living that emphasizes appreciating beauty and being blissful while still self-actualizing.

The author provides excellent synthesis of the tradition from both a spiritual and scholarly lens. He provides explanations for the entire belief system that indicate his own spiritual understanding and highlights the important history that led to its creation.

I wouldn't recommend this book for most; instead I would recommend starting with a more approable eastern philosophy first like Buddhism or Vedanta for those curious, as Kashmir Shaivism builds on ideas from there.

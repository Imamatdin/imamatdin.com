A straightforward introduction to real estate by William J. Poorvu, a successful real estate investor who taught about the topic at Harvard Business School for over 30 years.

He covers all the stages of the real estate game: concept, commitment, development, operations, and harvesting. In each stage, he discusses common pitfalls and all the steps to success

He also highlights that real estate is unique in the diversity of valid strategies it affords, leaving room for entrepreneurs to carve their own path to success based on their subjective preferences in risk tolerance, active vs. passive investment strategies, aesthetic, location, industry, and much more.

Great for quickly familiarizing yourself with the scope of the entire real estate business and the details of every element involved. Lacking in the impressive concision, contrarian insight, or unique perspective that would make the book interesting for people not directly involved in the industry.

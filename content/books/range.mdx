I was excited at the concept of a book about generalists and why generalism is useful. Was expecting some insight on how to be a generalist effectively, some of the potential downsides, or an exploration of why its so valuable.

Instead it basically just turned into one of the classic filler content books that's been hashed out thousands of times with the "story -> lesson -> repeat" strategy, with lots of stories that don't add much to the book, all boiling back down to the same idea. I was pretty dissapointed in the end, with such an interesting topic, but very little actual value or insight delivered.

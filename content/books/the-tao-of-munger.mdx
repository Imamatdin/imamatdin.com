A compilation of Charlie Munger quotes with helpful commentary from David Clark. I found this to be far more representative of Munger's wisdom than _Poor Charlie's Almanack_.

If you've read Berkshire shareholder letters or the variety of other writings that mention Buffet and Munger, most of this book will come as helpful reminders rather than new ideas.

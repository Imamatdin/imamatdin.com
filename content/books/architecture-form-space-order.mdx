Considered a classic introduction to the simplest principles of architecture. I expected an explanation of design and aesthetics in architecture built up from the elements of form, space, and order. Instead, the book was mostly nice drawings, fluff, and a laundry list of unmotivated concepts.

Ching goes over every single shape and element (ex: line, circle, square, plane) at a painstaking pace and injects his flowery commentary everywhere without saying much of substance. He presents each idea without explaining why it's relevant or how it can be used to any practical end.

The fact that this book is highly regarded is surprising to me, and reflects on the nature of modern architectural education. It seems like the author is trying to create the perception of abstractness and complexity to make his field seem more artistic and skillful.

The women's equivalent of _King Warrior Magician Lover_. Jean Bolen is a psychiatrist and analytical psychologist who synthesizes her insight from decades of experience into the 7 archetypes of modern femininity, characterized by the 7 Greek olympian goddesses.

The archetypes are not meant to be mutually exclusive, but instead describe the different aspects of the female psychology that can naturally coexist. She focuses on the dependent female roles like the wife (Hera), mother (Demeter), and daughter (Persephone), as well as the independent roles like separation from men (Artemis), cooperation with men (Athena), and indifference toward men (Hestia), along with the wildcard lover archetype (Aprhodite).

Surprisingly good observations about each archetypes behavior in each stage of life, marriage, work, sexuality, and preferences in partners. Many of her predictions were spot on for women in my life.

The book is primarily designed to help women grow into mature femininity, but I would also consider this essential reading for all men.

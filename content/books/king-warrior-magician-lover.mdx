Immature masculinity runs rampant in modern society due to the collapse of social functions like ritual intitiation and the lack of mature masculine role models. This boyish masculinity is the source of unwarranted aggression, infidelity, and insecurity projected into the world.

This book offers a reflection on masculinity by presenting the 4 archetypes of immature boyhood and the 4 archetypes of mature masculinity.

Each archetype resonates heavily and aligns with mens' behavior. The mature masculine archetypes are each worthy points of aspiration. I didn't fully appreciate the value and relevance of psychological archetypes until I read this book.

The authors are highly reflective on the state of masculinity and femininity in modern civilization and inject their own wisdom throughout the book. They present their observations through the lens of Jungian psychology.

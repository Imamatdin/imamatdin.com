All great nations go through cycles that lead to their inevitable rise and fall. In this book, Ray Dalio writes about about the common indicators that repeat themselves across history which lead to the rise and fall of global superpowers. Then, he goes on to make the case that the United States is currently showing all the signs of a power on the decline from it's peak, and that China is showing signs of being the next rising global power.

The power dynamics discussed in this book will be highly influential to everyone in the coming decades, and the new perspectives it gives you for understanding international relationships are ones that I haven't seen anywhere else.

A controversial but thought-provoking book on how men ought to act toward/with women. Many interesting ideas, mixed with Deida's largely unjustified claims stated as if they were apparent fact. I think there are many concepts in here which I don't currently agree with, which I could see myself being plausibly convinced of.

I gave it a low rating because there are many arbitrary/unjustified ideas that are somewhat destructive to spread - but I actually to quite like how unconventional Deida's ideas are and suspect that if I read this again in the future and spend more time thinking about what he has to say, my rating could improve.

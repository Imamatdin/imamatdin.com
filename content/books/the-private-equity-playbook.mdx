A concise introduction to private equity, similar to _The Real Estate Game_. Written from the perspective of a business owner who has sold to and worked with private equity multiple times across three decades.

Good for quickly learning about the fundamentals of private equity firms, deal structuring, and value add styles. Everything is about increasing EBITDA through organic growth, margin expansion, and buy and build strategies.

I'd expect there is some missing nuance here since it is the written from the perspective of a seller into PE, rather than a fund manager.

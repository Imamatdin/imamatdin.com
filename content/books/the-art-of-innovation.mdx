IDEO is the legendary product design lab that helped design Apple's first mouse, the Palm V, and many other products for companies like Coca Cola, Eli Lily, and Ford. They managed to create a culture of innovation second only to Bell Labs and Xerox PARC. Designign such organizations is a lost art.

Tom Kelley, the founder of IDEO, breaks down his reflections on every important aspect of his organization design and product philosophy including the art of observation, ideation, prototyping, team design, environment design, experience design, etc.

He speaks on the topic with insight and simplicity I have found in no recent books or founders.

A compilation of Osho's spoken lectures on courage and risk-taking. This sentence from the book captures his perspective well: "don't call it uncertainty - call it wonder; don't call it insecurity - call it freedom."

Truly living and growing means constantly going into the unknown and taking risk. Courage is not the lack of fear, but the willingness to take risk in spite of fear.

The core ideas of this book are valuable, but the editorial work is lacking. Many of the lectures the editors selected don't directly build on the central theme, and many questionable ideas are presented without justification, like the idea that love is the exact opposite of fear.

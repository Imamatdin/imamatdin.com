Wow. Being surrounded by Elon's life is incredible. Isaacson does an excellent job highlighting the right stories to provide a full picture of Elon and let you draw your own conclusions.

Elon is exceptionally agentic. He has a strong belief in his ability to turn ideas from imagination into reality. He is aggressively first-principled and focused on product and engineering over everything else. He constantly gravitates toward risk and takes dangerous, often costly bets.

On the other hand, Elon is also deeply flawed, mercurial, and immature. He frequently has manic outbursts and his personal life is full of drama.

Isaacson implies that Elon's flaws are necessary for his success. Instead, I see his success as an affirmation that you can achieve incredible results with a wide variety of dispositions and despite massive personal faults, as long as you possess a few essential qualities.

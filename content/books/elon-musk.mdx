Wow. Being surrounded by Elon's life is incredible. His personality and behaviors are so unique that the book is almost jarring.

Isaacson's narrative and analysis are alright (I find [The Cook and the Chef](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html) to be a better overview of Elon's thinking), but he does an excellent job highlighting the right stories to provide a full picture of Elon and let you draw your own conclusions.

Elon is exceptionally agentic. He has compounded his belief in his ability to turn ideas from his imagination into reality. He is aggressively first-principled and focused on product and engineering over everything else. He constantly gravitates toward risk and takes dangerous, often costly bets.

On the other hand, Elon is also deeply flawed, mercurial, and immature. Isaacson highlights the constant drama in his personal life and the manic outbursts that define his interactions with others.

Isaacson implies that Elon's flaws are necessary for his success. Instead, I see his success as a result of the overwhelming power of his strengths, and as an indication that you can achieve incredible results with a wide variety of dispositions.

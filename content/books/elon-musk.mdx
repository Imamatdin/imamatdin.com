Wow. Being surrounded by Elon's life is incredible. Isaacson's narrative and analysis are alright ([The Cook and the Chef](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html) is better), but he does an excellent job highlighting the right stories to provide a full picture of Elon and let you draw your own conclusions.

Elon is exceptionally agentic. He has a strong belief in his ability to turn ideas from imagination into reality. He is aggressively first-principled and focused on product and engineering over everything else. He constantly gravitates toward risk and takes dangerous, often costly bets.

On the other hand, Elon is also deeply flawed, mercurial, and immature. He frequently has manic outbursts and his personal life is full of drama.

Isaacson implies that Elon's flaws are necessary for his success. Instead, I see his success as an indication that you can achieve incredible results despite personal faults, as long as you possess a few essential qualities that most people lack.

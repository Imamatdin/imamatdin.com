## Who She Was

Rosalind Franklin was a British chemist whose work was crucial to understanding the molecular structures of DNA, RNA, viruses, coal, and graphite.

## Her Contributions

Her X-ray diffraction images of DNA, particularly "Photo 51," were critical evidence in identifying the double helix structure of DNA. However, her contributions were largely overlooked during her lifetime.

## Why She Matters to Me

Franklin's story resonates with me because it highlights how brilliant work can go unrecognized due to circumstances beyond one's control. Her dedication to rigorous scientific methodology, despite facing significant barriers as a woman in 1950s science, is incredibly inspiring.

## The Lesson

Her story teaches me the importance of:
- Persistence in the face of adversity
- Rigorous methodology and attention to detail
- Standing up for proper credit and recognition
- The often-invisible contributions that make breakthroughs possible

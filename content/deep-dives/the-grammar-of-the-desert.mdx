## Premise

The plants of the Kyzylkum Desert are masters of fluid dynamics, their surfaces covered in micro-textures evolved to capture every possible drop of moisture from the air. This isn't random; it's a physical language of survival written on the surface of a leaf.

## Project

Research and document the surface textures of 3-5 plants native to Karakalpakstan. Develop a computational shape grammar, a set of rules for combining simple geometric forms, that can procedurally generate these textures. The tangible result is the software tool and a design portfolio of novel, bio-inspired surfaces for passive water condensation, all generated from your grammar.

## Premise

The Miasma Theory, the belief that "bad air" caused disease, was wrong, but it wasn't stupid. It led to profound changes in urban design, like wider streets and better sanitation, because people intuitively understood that airflow mattered. Today, we face a new miasma of airborne pollutants.

## Project

Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, create a 3D model of a generic city block. Simulate the flow and concentration of airborne particulates (our modern miasma). Then, redesign the block based on Miasma Theory principles, increasing airflow, creating open spaces, and run the simulation again. The tangible result is a comparative visual analysis and a paper titled "Learning from Wrong Ideas: A Miasma-Based Model for Healthier Urban Airflows."

## Premise

Engineers, like all humans, are prone to cognitive biases (e.g., confirmation bias, functional fixedness). These biases can lead to suboptimal designs, missed opportunities, and costly errors.

## Project

Design and write the pseudo-code for an AI assistant that analyzes an engineer's design log. The AI's goal is not to suggest solutions, but to detect patterns indicative of cognitive bias and ask targeted questions to prompt the human to think differently.

## Premise

The Antikythera Mechanism, an ancient Greek analog computer, used a breathtakingly complex system of gears to predict astronomical events. It was a physical embodiment of mathematical theory. Modern engineers often see gears as simple components, but here they formed a language.

## Project

Create a complete, functional, and animated 3D CAD model of the mechanism based on the latest research. Go beyond just modeling it. Write an accompanying engineering analysis of its gear trains, calculating transmission ratios, mechanical advantage, potential points of wear, and the propagation of error through the system. The tangible result is the CAD portfolio and your analytical paper.
